# Huffman-Tree-Algorithm
The code reads an input string, calculates the frequency of each character, constructs a Huffman tree based on these frequencies, and prints the Huffman codes for each character. The Huffman codes are binary strings representing the paths from the root to each character in the tree, providing an efficient way to encode the input string.
